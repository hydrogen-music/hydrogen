20xx-xx-xx the hydrogen team <hydrogen-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 1.2
	* General behavior
		- Remembering paths in all export/import/save/open dialogs.
		- Introducing keyboard shortcut for the Open Pattern dialog.
		- Allow for opening more than one Pattern at once.
		- All available audio drivers can now be chosen via CLI.
		- Implement missing EFFECT_LEVEL_RELATIVE MIDI action
		- If the Timeline is activated, the tempo set using the BPM
		  widget, BeatCounter, Tap Tempo, or MIDI/OSC commands is used left
		  of the first tempo marker.
		- The tempo provided by an external JACK timebase master
		  overwrites all internal tempo settings.
		- The BPM widget switches to read-only mode and displays the
		  current playback speed when the Timeline is activated.
		- Activation of the Timeline is now stored in each individual
		  .h2song file.
	* Interface
		- Improved scalability (most PNG images were replaced by SVGs,
		  hardcoded PNG labels are now directly drawn by Qt, and spin boxes,
		  buttons, and combo boxes are now based on native Qt widgets)
		- Improved internationalization (all labels are translatable now
		  and support UTF-8)
		- Improved accessibility (widgets were increased to fill available
		  space, preference option to (de- and) increase font size)
		- All colors can be altered via the preferences
		- Input widgets (rotary, fader, combo box, spin box, button) do
		  support both mouse and keyboard input (e.g. setting numerical values)
		- Input widgets are faintly highlighted when hovered and more
		  strongly highlighted when clicked (focuses). Only the focused
		  widget can receive keyboard input
		- MIDI-learnable widgets now show their corresponding MIDI action
		  and it's binding in the tooltip
		- It's now possible to jump to the beginning of the currently
		  playing pattern by clicking its position on the ruler.
	* PreferencesDialog > Appearance tab overhaul
	  	- Drop previous font options in favor for three different
		  levels of font (without exposing their point sizes)
		- Ability to decrease or increase the overall font size
		- All settings in the Appearance tab - except the overall layout
		  and the scaling policy - take effect immediately (no restart
		  required anymore)
		- Drop the "fixed" coloring methods and rename "steps" to
		  "Custom".
		- Via a colored button the particular line color can now be
		  adjusted using a QColorDialog
		- Custom color tab to alter all colors in the GUI (big thanks to
		  the Muse4 team for the original code).
		- All options set in the Appearance tab can be imported and
		  exported into and shared via dedicated .h2theme files.
		- Overhauled MIDI Table
		  - Per effect or layer setting are now done in dedicated spin
		    boxes instead of providing individual actions for each.
		  - Only spin boxes for parameters required for a particular
		    action are shown.
		  - Rows can be removed by unsetting both the Event and Action
		    combo box.
	* InstrumentEditor UX improvements:
		- rework start/end/loop frame slider selection and motion.
		- rework velocity/pan envelope editing
	* SongEditor UX improvements:
		- Tags can now be inserted at all possible columns
		- Hovering a Tag displays its content
		- Changed behavior of the Tempo Marker dialog: When clicking an
		  existing Tempo Marker it can be moved, edited, or
		  deleted. Clicking a column with no Tempo Marker present allows
		  to create a new one at an arbitrary location.
		- Timeline is deactivated automatically when switching to Pattern
		  Mode or a JACK timebase master is present
		- The tempo used left of the first tempo marker is painted in a
		  darker color.
		- The currently used Tempo Marker gets highlighted.
	* Bugfixes
		- fix dithering of SongEditor when viewing the playback track
		  and resizing the application or for very small size (#1379).
		- fix rewinding to beginning of pattern in pattern mode with no
		  pattern inserted in SongEditor (#932)
		- fix display of tags and tempo marker while loading a song
		  (introduced in 1.1.0) (#1393)
		- default MIDI driver is now picked with the system's capabilities
		in mind
		- remove unwanted samples at the end of the exported song (to
		  .wav) (#946)
		- fix undefined tempo before first tempo marker (#416)

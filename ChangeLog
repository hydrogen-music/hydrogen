	* Release 2.0.0
	* Added
		- PortMidi driver does open a input/output port which can be
		  discovered and connected to by other applications when port was
		  set to "None" in the Preferences (not supported on Windows).
		- All keyboard shortcuts including the virtual keyboard can now be
		  customized in Preferences > Shortcuts.
		- Most actions available via MIDI or OSC can also be assigned to a
		  keyboard shortcut. If those actions require input arguments,
		  they are retrieved using popup dialogs.
		- Align to grid action in Pattern Editor to align
		  exsiting notes to current grid.
		- Switching drumkits, replace the current kit by a new one, as well as
			adding, deleting, and renaming drumkit components can now be undone.
		- Pattern and drumkit properties can be edited by clicking the corresponding
			name in the left column of the Pattern Editor.
		- new OSC commands:
				- `NEW_PLAYLIST`
				- `OPEN_PLAYLIST`
				- `SAVE_PLAYLIST`
				- `SAVE_PLAYLIST_AS`
				- `PLAYLIST_ADD_SONG`
				- `PLAYLIST_ADD_CURRENT_SONG`
				- `PLAYLIST_REMOVE_SONG`
				- `LOAD_PREV_DRUMKIT` (cycling through drumkits)
				- `LOAD_NEXT_DRUMKIT` (cycling through drumkits)
		- new MIDI actions:

				- `LOAD_NEXT_DRUMKIT` (cycling through drumkits)
		- `.h2playlist` files are now backed up by and can be restored from autosave
			files as well.
		- CLI options:
				- `kitToDrumkitMap`: to extract a .h2map file from a drumkit
		- Patterns are now independent of Drumkits and the latter can switched
			without the need to adjust the patterns. Mapping between the two will be
			done using "instrument types".
		- `<instrumentComponent>` and `<instrumentLayer>` elements in drumkit XML
			definitions contain two new elements: `<isMuted>` and `<isSoloed>`.
	* Changed
		- Drumkit handling was reworked. Each song will now hold a proper drumkit.
			Tweaking its name, instruments etc. does not affect the kits in the Sound
			Library (user and system drumkit folder) unless it is explicitly saved to
			it. All actions in the Main Menu > Drumkit only affect the song's kit. All
			actions in the Sound Library do only affect the selected kit and not the one
			of the current song (except loading).
		- .h2song file format changed. (forward compatible only with v1.2.4 and newer).
		- Drumkit format changed.
				- Adjustments done in the Sample Editor are now stored in the kit as
				  well (previously, this was only possible in songs).
				- Drumkit components (`<componentList>`) were dropped.
		- (Instrument) Components are now independent of each other and can be added
			separately for each instrument.
		- Notes in .h2pattern files as well as instruments in .h2drumkits do now have
			a new property `type`.
		- Prerelease version suffix (alpha, beta, rc..) are now appended to
			the shared library of the core, `libhydrogen-core-X.X.X.so/.dll`.
		- Preferences dialog can now be smoothly resized.
		- MIDI action `>>_NEXT_BAR` and `<<_PREVIOUS_BAR` - as well as
		  their OSC counterparts - do now wrap transport around the
		  beginning and end of a song if loop mode is enabled. In pattern
		  mode they move transport to be beginning and next is updating
		  pending stacked patterns.
		- PlaylistEditor:
				- All actions can now be undone and redone.
				- Songs can be loaded by keyboard selection and pressing Enter key.
				- Playlist can be rearranged using drag and drop.
		- NSM:
				- Drumkits are no longer linked into the session folder
				- All drumkits in the session folder (proper drumkit folders containing
				  samples. Linked ones are not supported) as available as session kits
				  in the Sound Library.
				- New action in Main Menu to save kit to session folder.
		- Online import dialog now allows for multiple downloads at once (#1143).
		- `userVersion` element was added to `.h2song`, `.h2pattern`, and drumkit
			files. It can be set using the corresponding properties dialog and can
			help to tell different artifact versions apart.
		- `formatVersion` element was added to `.h2song`, `.h2pattern`, `.h2playlist`,
			drumkit and config files. This integer will be increment each time the
			format will be changed.
		- pre-fader gain does now include component gain as well.
	* Fixed
		- Components can now carry arbitrary names and name duplication is handled
			properly.
		- Paths to songs and scripts are now properly saved relative to a
			`.h2playlist` file (in case the corresponding option was set).
	* Removed
		- Preferences options `restoreLastSong` and `restoreLastPlaylist` were
			dropped. Instead, both will always be restored automatically. In order to
			start with a blank song/playlist, load a new one before quitting.
		- Component mixer strips have been dropped.

XXXX-XX-XX the hydrogen team <hydrogen-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 1.2.4
	* Added
		- MIDI and OSC commands
				- `CLEAR_SELECTED_INSTRUMENT` - to remove all notes of the selected
				  pattern associated with the currently selected instrument.
				- `CLEAR_PATTERN` - to remove all notes of the selected pattern.
				- `INSTRUMENT_PITCH` - to adjust the pitch of an instrument.
		- OSC commands
				- `NOTE_ON` and `NOTE_OFF` which are handled like incoming MIDI events
				  without triggering their associated actions.
				- `CLEAR_INSTRUMENT` - to remove all notes of the selected pattern
 				  associated with the provided instrument number.
		- CLI option:
			- `-O`/`--osc-port` to use a custom OSC port in both `hydrogen`
			  and `h2cli`.
			- `-L`/`--log-file` to provide a path to an alternative log file.

		- Adding support for importing and exporting audio files of format `.mp3`,
			`.opus`, `.au`, `.caf`, `.voc`, `.w64`. Drumkits containing those formats
			can be loaded with older versions of Hydrogen too. `libsndfile` >= `1.1.0`
			is required on your system for MP3 support. (#2023)
		- `X-NSM-Exec` entry added to `org.hydrogenmusic.Hydrogen.desktop` by
			@grammoboy2 (#2042).
		- Delete key does now remove selected notes and notes under cursor in

	* Changed
		- Grid lines in the Song Editor are now rendered dotted to emphasize that
			this is the space the patterns in rather than objects in their own right.
		- Virtual keyboard strokes are now mapped exactly as incoming MIDI `NOTE_ON`
			events (respecting both "Use output note as input note" and hihat pressure
			groups). But do not trigger associated actions (#1770).
		- CLI option `-d` understand driver names regardless of capitalization.
		- `h2cli` option `-V` is now able to handle whitespaces between flag and
			argument.

	* Fixed
		- Restore mute button state of master mixer strip on song load.
		- Recorded MIDI notes were inserted ahead of the beat (#1851).
		- Drumkit Property Dialog:
				- Images were written regardless whether one hits the ok or

2023-09-09 the hydrogen team <hydrogen-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 1.2.2
	* Added
		- Hydrogen is now released as AppImage for Linux as well.
		- Playlist dialog can now be resized and remembers geometry,
		  position, as well as visibility.
		- Save and restore Director position, geometry, and visibility.
		- New and properly licensed AppStream metainfo files
		  `org.hydrogenmusic.Hydrogen.metainfo.xml` replace old
		  `org.hydrogenmusic.Hydrogen.appdata.xml`.
		- Hydrogen shows an error dialog and exits on the first invocation
		  with no hydrogen.conf file present on user and system level
		  (application was not properly installed).
		- A new `cmake` option `WANT_DYNAMIC_JACK_CHECK` was
		  introduced. When set Hydrogen does check on startup whether
		  `jackd`, `jackdbus`, or `pw-jack` is installed and disables JACK
		  support in case none of them was found. This is intended for
		  bundled builds, like AppImage and Flatpak, and can be overridden
		  by setting the audio driver manually to "Jack" in the
		  hydrogen.conf or by passing the "-d jack" CLI option.
	* Changed
		- Spanish translation updated.
		- Minor tweaks in French and German translation.
		- On Linux the order of audio drivers tried when selecting `Auto`
		  changed from "JACK > ALSA > OSS > PulseAudio" to

		  Instrument Editor if the specified instrument was not the
		  currently selected one.
		- Do not start playback at cursor when cursor in Song Editor is
		  beyond the current song length.
		- Fixed compatibility with PortMidi version 217 (Hydrogen v1.2.1
		  was incompatible) (#1795). All versions of Hydrogen >=1.3 will,
		  however, require on a more recent PortMidi version (at least
		  v2.0.1).
		- Fixed allowed range of MIDI output notes to be [0,127] again
		  (#1828) (introduced in v1.2.0).
		- Hydrogen does now successfully startup even if no data folder is
		  present on user and system level.
		- Allow an arbitrary number of notes in a pattern (#1827).

		  dialog will be reopened too at the same position.
		- Fix spurious marking of opened songs as modified.
		- Fix MIDI (output) feedback for metronome toggling and pan
		  setting.

2023-04-07 the hydrogen team <hydrogen-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 1.2
	* General behavior
		- Remembering paths in all export/import/save/open dialogs.
		- Introducing keyboard shortcut for the Open Pattern dialog.
		- Allow for opening more than one Pattern at once.
		- All available audio drivers can now be chosen via CLI.
		- Implement missing EFFECT_LEVEL_RELATIVE MIDI action
		- If the Timeline is activated, the tempo set using the BPM
		  widget, BeatCounter, Tap Tempo, or MIDI/OSC commands is used left
		  of the first tempo marker.
		- The tempo provided by an external JACK timebase master
		  overwrites all internal tempo settings.
		- The BPM widget switches to read-only mode and displays the
		  current playback speed when the Timeline is activated.
		- Activation of the Timeline is now stored in each individual
		  .h2song file.
		- Autosave files will be hidden. The interval they are stored with
		  as well whether there is an autosave at all can be set via the
		  Preferences. Hydrogen will inform the user whether there are
		  unsaved changes to recover taken from the autosave file.
		- Hydrogen is now able to recover changes applied to a new and
		  empty song in case they are discarded or the session end
		  untimely (using autosave files)
		- Multiple actions can be assigned to a single MIDI event.
		- The virtual keyboard is now decoupled from the "Hear New Notes"
		  button in the Pattern Editor and can be used to play back notes in
		  song mode with playback rolling too.
		- Mutable warning dialogs are shown when saving/exporting a
		  drumkit containing samples of mismatching license and when
		  saving/exporting a drumkit or song containing a copyleft license
		  or one requiring an attribution.
		- Drumkit properties dialog does now feature a table listing all
		  contained samples and associated licenses.
		- All actions accessible via right-clicking in the SoundLibrary do
		  affect the stack drumkits and not the instrument list of the
		  current song.
		- All actions accessible via the Drumkits tab of the main menu do
		  affect the loaded drumkit using the current song's custom
		  instrument and component list.
	* Interface
		- Improved scalability (most PNG images were replaced by SVGs,
		  hardcoded PNG labels are now directly drawn by Qt, and spin boxes,
		  buttons, and combo boxes are now based on native Qt widgets)
		- Improved internationalization (all labels are translatable now
		  and support UTF-8)
		- Improved accessibility (widgets were increased to fill available
		  space, preference option to (de- and) increase font size)
		- All colors can be altered via the preferences
		- Input widgets (rotary, fader, combo box, spin box, button) do
		  support both mouse and keyboard input (e.g. setting numerical values)
		- Input widgets are faintly highlighted when hovered and more
		  strongly highlighted when clicked (focuses). Only the focused
		  widget can receive keyboard input
		- MIDI-learnable widgets now show their corresponding MIDI action
		  and it's binding in the tooltip
		- It's now possible to jump to the beginning of the currently
		  playing pattern by clicking its position on the ruler in the
		  pattern editor.
		- The length of patterns can now be changed while transport is
		  rolling.
	* PreferencesDialog > Appearance tab overhaul
	  	- Drop previous font options in favor for three different
		  levels of font (without exposing their point sizes)
		- Ability to decrease or increase the overall font size
		- All settings in the Appearance tab - except the overall layout
		  and the scaling policy - take effect immediately (no restart
		  required anymore)
		- Drop the "fixed" coloring methods and rename "steps" to
		  "Custom".
		- Via a colored button the particular line color can now be
		  adjusted using a QColorDialog
		- Custom color tab to alter all colors in the GUI (big thanks to
		  the Muse4 team for the original code).
		- All options set in the Appearance tab can be imported and
		  exported into and shared via dedicated .h2theme files.
		- Overhauled MIDI Table
		  - Per effect or layer setting are now done in dedicated spin
		    boxes instead of providing individual actions for each.
		  - Only spin boxes for parameters required for a particular
		    action are shown.
		  - Rows can be removed by unsetting both the Event and Action
		    combo box.
		- Clicking the widget showing the status messages does now open a
		  dropdown menu displaying the last 100 messages.
	* Audio processing
		- Set CoreAudio (macOS) buffer size to control latency
		- New fast exponential ADSR envelope processing
	* InstrumentEditor UX improvements:
		- rework start/end/loop frame slider selection and motion.
		- rework velocity/pan envelope editing
	* SongEditor UX improvements:
		- Tags can now be inserted at all possible columns
		- Hovering a Tag displays its content
		- Changed behavior of the Tempo Marker dialog: When clicking an
		  existing Tempo Marker it can be moved, edited, or
		  deleted. Clicking a column with no Tempo Marker present allows
		  to create a new one at an arbitrary location.
		- Timeline is deactivated automatically when switching to Pattern
		  Mode or a JACK timebase master is present
		- The tempo used left of the first tempo marker is painted in a
		  darker color.
		- The currently used Tempo Marker gets highlighted.
		- Tags have been moved into Timeline (next to the Tempo Markers)
		  in order to make room to accommodate the cursor in the ruler to
		  highlight the current position
		- Tags can be inserted by left-clicking the bottom area of the
		  Timeline (above the ruler).
		- Clicking the ruler is now always enabled and automatically
		  switches transport into Song Mode.
		- Full-size playhead
		- The icons in the pattern list indicating whether a pattern is
		  playing in stacked pattern mode are now colored and can have four
		  different states: on, off, off next (pattern is played till the
		  end and then turned off), and on next (pattern is played as soon
		  as transport is looped again)
		- In song mode the pattern editor can be locked meaning that
		  always the bottom-most pattern of the current column the
		  playhead resides in as well as all other playing notes are
		  shown. Pattern selection is done automatically when moving into
		  a different column.
	* PatternEditor UX tweaks:
		- Relocating transport by clicking the ruler is now supported
		  (like in the SongEditor) and automatically switches transport
		  into Pattern Mode.
		- Full-size playhead
		- The ruler was decoupled from the currently selected pattern. It
		  always has the size of the largest playing pattern and always
		  shows the transport position using a playhead. Whether or not the
		  current pattern is played back is indicated by a full-height
		  cursor.
		- All note properties except of the note key can now be altered in
		  both the drum pattern editor and the piano roll editor by
		  right-clicking and dragging a note.
		- All notes of the currently playing patterns will be hinted in
		  stacked pattern mode, when selecting a virtual pattern, or in
		  case the pattern editor is locked in song mode. Even those notes
		  exceeding the length of the current pattern are shown.

		- Add `--upgrade` option to upgrade a drumkit
		- Add `--check` option to validate a drumkit
		- Add `--extract` option to extract the content of a drumkit
		- Drumkit supplied using `-k` option can now be either the name of
		  an install kit or an absolute path to a kit (does not have to be
		  located in the Hydrogen's drumkit folder).
	* Bugfixes
		- fix dithering of SongEditor when viewing the playback track
		  and resizing the application or for very small size (#1379).
		- fix rewinding to beginning of pattern in pattern mode with no
		  pattern inserted in SongEditor (#932)

20xx-xx-xx the hydrogen team <hydrogen-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 1.2
	* General behavior
		- Remembering paths in all export/import/save/open dialogs.
		- Introducing keyboard shortcut for the Open Pattern dialog.
		- Allow for opening more than one Pattern at once.
		- All available audio drivers can now be chosen via CLI.
		- Implement missing EFFECT_LEVEL_RELATIVE MIDI action
		- If the Timeline is activated, the tempo set using the BPM
		  widget, BeatCounter, Tap Tempo, or MIDI/OSC commands is used left
		  of the first tempo marker.
		- The tempo provided by an external JACK timebase master
		  overwrites all internal tempo settings.
		- The BPM widget switches to read-only mode and displays the
		  current playback speed when the Timeline is activated.
		- Activation of the Timeline is now stored in each individual
		  .h2song file.
		- Autosave files will be hidden. The interval they are stored with
		  as well whether there is an autosave at all can be set via the
		  Preferences. Hydrogen will inform the user whether there are
		  unsaved changes to recover taken from the autosave file.
		- Hydrogen is now able to recover changes applied to a new and
		  empty song in case they are discarded or the session end
		  untimely (using autosave files)
		- Multiple actions can be assigned to a single MIDI event.
		- The virtual keyboard is now decoupled from the "Hear New Notes"
		  button in the Pattern Editor and can be used to play back notes in
		  song mode with playback rolling too.
		- Mutable warning dialogs are shown when saving/exporting a
		  drumkit containing samples of mismatching license and when
		  saving/exporting a drumkit or song containing a copyleft license
		  or one requiring an attribution.
		- Drumkit properties dialog does now feature a table listing all
		  contained samples and associated licenses.
		- All actions accessible via right-clicking in the SoundLibrary do
		  affect the stack drumkits and not the instrument list of the
		  current song.
		- All actions accessible via the Drumkits tab of the main menu do
		  affect the loaded drumkit using the current song's custom
		  instrument and component list.
	* Interface
		- Improved scalability (most PNG images were replaced by SVGs,
		  hardcoded PNG labels are now directly drawn by Qt, and spin boxes,
		  buttons, and combo boxes are now based on native Qt widgets)
		- Improved internationalization (all labels are translatable now
		  and support UTF-8)
		- Improved accessibility (widgets were increased to fill available
		  space, preference option to (de- and) increase font size)
		- All colors can be altered via the preferences
		- Input widgets (rotary, fader, combo box, spin box, button) do
		  support both mouse and keyboard input (e.g. setting numerical values)
		- Input widgets are faintly highlighted when hovered and more
		  strongly highlighted when clicked (focuses). Only the focused
		  widget can receive keyboard input
		- MIDI-learnable widgets now show their corresponding MIDI action
		  and it's binding in the tooltip
		- It's now possible to jump to the beginning of the currently
		  playing pattern by clicking its position on the ruler in the
		  pattern editor.
		- The length of patterns can now be changed while transport is
		  rolling.
	* PreferencesDialog > Appearance tab overhaul
	  	- Drop previous font options in favor for three different
		  levels of font (without exposing their point sizes)
		- Ability to decrease or increase the overall font size
		- All settings in the Appearance tab - except the overall layout
		  and the scaling policy - take effect immediately (no restart
		  required anymore)
		- Drop the "fixed" coloring methods and rename "steps" to
		  "Custom".
		- Via a colored button the particular line color can now be
		  adjusted using a QColorDialog
		- Custom color tab to alter all colors in the GUI (big thanks to
		  the Muse4 team for the original code).
		- All options set in the Appearance tab can be imported and
		  exported into and shared via dedicated .h2theme files.
		- Overhauled MIDI Table
		  - Per effect or layer setting are now done in dedicated spin
		    boxes instead of providing individual actions for each.
		  - Only spin boxes for parameters required for a particular
		    action are shown.
		  - Rows can be removed by unsetting both the Event and Action
		    combo box.
		- Clicking the widget showing the status messages does now open a
		  dropdown menu displaying the last 100 messages.
	* Audio processing
		- Set CoreAudio (macOS) buffer size to control latency
		- New fast exponential ADSR envelope processing
	* InstrumentEditor UX improvements:
		- rework start/end/loop frame slider selection and motion.
		- rework velocity/pan envelope editing
	* SongEditor UX improvements:
		- Tags can now be inserted at all possible columns
		- Hovering a Tag displays its content
		- Changed behavior of the Tempo Marker dialog: When clicking an
		  existing Tempo Marker it can be moved, edited, or
		  deleted. Clicking a column with no Tempo Marker present allows
		  to create a new one at an arbitrary location.
		- Timeline is deactivated automatically when switching to Pattern
		  Mode or a JACK timebase master is present
		- The tempo used left of the first tempo marker is painted in a
		  darker color.
		- The currently used Tempo Marker gets highlighted.
		- Tags have been moved into Timeline (next to the Tempo Markers)
		  in order to make room to accommodate the cursor in the ruler to
		  highlight the current position
		- Tags can be inserted by left-clicking the bottom area of the
		  Timeline (above the ruler).
		- Clicking the ruler is now always enabled and automatically
		  switches transport into Song Mode.
		- Full-size playhead
		- The icons in the pattern list indicating whether a pattern is
		  playing in stacked pattern mode are now colored and can have four
		  different states: on, off, off next (pattern is played till the
		  end and then turned off), and on next (pattern is played as soon
		  as transport is looped again)
	* PatternEditor UX tweaks:
		- Relocating transport by clicking the ruler is now supported
		  (like in the SongEditor) and automatically switches transport
		  into Pattern Mode.
		- Full-size playhead
		- The ruler was decoupled from the currently selected pattern. It
		  always has the size of the largest playing pattern and always
		  shows the transport position using a playhead. Whether or not the
		  current pattern is played back is indicated by a full-height
		  cursor.
		- All note properties except of the note key can now be altered in
		  both the drum pattern editor and the piano roll editor by
		  right-clicking and dragging a note.
		- All notes of the currently playing patterns will be hinted in
		  stacked pattern mode. Even those exceeding the length of the
		  current pattern.
	* OSC API
		- Add command /Hydrogen/LOAD_DRUMKIT
		- Add command /Hydrogen/UPGRADE_DRUMKIT
		- Add command /Hydrogen/VALIDATE_DRUMKIT
		- Add command /Hydrogen/EXTRACT_DRUMKIT
		- Add command /Hydrogen/BPM
		- /Hydrogen/STRIP_SOLO_TOGGLE/X and /Hydrogen/STRIP_MUTE_TOGGLE/X
		  can now be called without any argument too
	* H2CLI
		- Add `--upgrade` option to upgrade a drumkit
		- Add `--check` option to validate a drumkit
		- Add `--extract` option to extract the content of a drumkit
		- Drumkit supplied using `-k` option can now be either the name of
		  an install kit or an absolute path to a kit (does not have to be
		  located in the Hydrogen's drumkit folder).
	* Bugfixes
		- fix dithering of SongEditor when viewing the playback track
		  and resizing the application or for very small size (#1379).
		- fix rewinding to beginning of pattern in pattern mode with no
		  pattern inserted in SongEditor (#932)
		- fix display of tags and tempo marker while loading a song
		  (introduced in 1.1.0) (#1393)
		- default MIDI driver is now picked with the system's capabilities
		  in mind
		- remove unwanted samples at the end of the exported song (to
		  .wav) (#946)
		- fix undefined tempo before first tempo marker (#416)
		- fix Song export to keep writing till all notes and FX have faded
		  out
		- notes at first ticks in pattern were missed when relocation
		  transport using the position ruler
		- fix playhead glitches when adding toggling patterns at the end
		  of the song after transport was loop at least once
		- deactivating loop mode result stopping transport at the end of
		  the song even if transport was already looped at least once
		- relocation of the playhead use JACK is now also support in case
		  transport is not rolling
		- Hydrogen is now able to handle multiple drumkits featuring the
		  same name in the SoundLibrary. The drumkit's absolute path will be
		  used as unique handler from now on.
		- Mixing instruments from different drumkit in one Song works again
	* Crash reporting
		- Fatal errors will now show a GUI report including details to report
		  and potential hints about the cause

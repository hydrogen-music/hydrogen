MAKING A RELEASE
----------------

Transitioning the code to remove some of the development hooks in
order to make a release has several, easy-to-forget steps.  They are:

  1. Remove the developer hook for 'version':

     a. Near the end of SConstruct, where it has 'extra_version',
        remove that.

     b. If you are bumping the revision, also do that in SConstruct.

     c. Update linux/debian/changelog

  2. Remove the 'developer warning': in data/hydrogen.default.conf
     change hydrogen_preferences/showDevelWarning to "false".

  3. Commit your changes to trunk.

  4. Make a tarball of the release (gzipped).  Use gzip instead of
     bzip2 for the folks on Windows.  Tarballs should be named:
                   
                   +--- Release version
                   |
                   |    +--- Extra release version info
                 __|__ _|_
        hydrogen-0.9.4-rc2.tar.gz

     Example: 'tar -pczf hydrogen-0.9.5.tar.gz hydrogen-0.9.5'

  5. If this is an RC release, the following steps are optional.

  6. In a clean directory, test build the tarball in as many ways as
     you can.  Call your friends.  Have a party.  Be sure to build
     packages on as many systems as possible.  Be sure to install
     and uninstall them, too.

  7. Go ahead and build binary packages.  Follow the naming convention
     for the platform that you're building for.

       Linux:    hydrogen_0.9.4rc2_distro_arch.pkg
                 distro:  the GNU/Linux distro (e.g. 'lenny' for Debian)
                 arch:    the processor it's built for (e.g. i686)
                 pkg:     the package management system (deb, rpm)
       OS X:     hydrogen_0.9.4rc2_arch.dmg
                 (arch is optional if the binary will work on both.)
       Windows:  hydrogen_0.9.4rc2.exe

  8. If the release passes these "internal" tests, tag the
     release.  Remember, after tagging the release you may not
     commit changes to the tag.

        svn cp http://svn.assembla.com/svn/hydrogen/trunk \
               http://svn.assembla.com/svn/hydrogen/tags/0.9.4

  9. If this is a major release (e.g. 0.9.4), then make a branch for
     maintenance patches for your release.  If this is a maintenance
     release (e.g. 0.9.4.1) then skip this step.

        svn cp http://svn.assembla.com/svn/hydrogen/trunk \
               http://svn.assembla.com/svn/hydrogen/branches/0.9.4

  10. Make announcements.

CODING CONVENTIONS
------------------

Use the 'linux' indention.  (i.e. Tabs) Allow extra space within
parentheses, like this:

     while( !done ) {
             foo();
     }

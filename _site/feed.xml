        <title>14 ways to contribute to Hydrogen !</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hydrogen team is happy to announce the ‘14 ways to contribute to Hydrogen’ campaign!&lt;br /&gt;
With this ‘campaign’ we are hoping to get some motivated people on board
Experienced programmers are of course very welcome, but we also want to make it as easy as possible for &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; to get involved in the project
For this purpose we created the ‘14 ways to contribute to Hydrogen’ page.&lt;br /&gt;
There you can find -surprise, surprise- 14 different ways you can contribute to Hydrogen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words : you just ran out of excuses why you cant contribute !  ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we hope to welcome you to the team very soon !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hydrogen team&lt;/p&gt;

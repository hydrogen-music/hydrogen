# ==== Bundles ====
#
# LV2 plugins are installed in ``bundles'', a directory with a particular
# format.  Inside the bundle, the entry point is a file called `manifest.ttl`.
# The manifest lists the plugins (or other resources) that are in this bundle,
# and the files that contain further information.
#
# Hosts typically read the `manifest.ttl` of every bundle when starting up to
# discover what LV2 plugins and other resources are present.  Accordingly,
# manifest files should be as small as possible for performance reasons.
#
#
# ==== Namespace Prefixes ====
#
# Turtle files contain many URIs.  To make this more readable, prefixes can be
# defined.  For example, with the `lv2:` prefix below, instead of
# <http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#Plugin> the shorter form `lv2:Plugin` can be
# used.  This is just a shorthand for URIs within one file, the prefixes are
# not significant otherwise.

@prefix lv2:  <http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

# ==== A Plugin Entry ====

      <para>First of all you should make sure that the audio engine is
      configured properly.  The preferences dialog can be accessed via the tools
      menu (tools -&gt; preferences).</para>

      <section id="sect.preferences.general_tab">
        <title>The General tab</title>
        
        <para>On the "General" tab (<xref linkend="fig.preferences.general_tab"/>) you can 
        choose to automatically reopen the last used song and/or playlist.  This can save you 
        the trouble of having to reopen the song you are working on every time you open 
        Hydrogen.  Auto loading the playlist can come in handy when you are using Hydrogen live.</para>
        <para>If you want to use Lash for session management you should enable 
        it here so Hydrogen allows interaction with Lash.  If jou are using Jack Session for session management
        you have to option to let Hydrogen automatically save the song file in the Jack Session Directory.</para>
        <para>The Beat Counter drift compensation and start offset allow you to compensate
         for system latency when you are using the Beat Counter function (see <xref linkend="sect.tap_tempo"/>)</para>
        <para>The Max number of bars in a song can be set here (currently limited to 800) 
        and if you want to use rubberband for sample time-streching (see <xref linkend="sect.layer_editing.section2"/>)
        you need to enter the path where rubberband is installed on you system here.</para>

        <title>The Audio System tab</title>

        <para>From the "Audio System" tab (<xref
        linkend="fig.preferences.audio_tab"/>) it is possible to modify the
        audio driver being used (OSS, Jack, ALSA, PortAudio, PulseAudio, CoreAudio) with its buffer and
        sampling rate (unless you are using JACK, in this case the audio driver
        configuration should happen before starting the JACK server).</para>

        <para>We can set some features of Hydrogen like "Create per-instrument outputs" 
        this will create 1 output per instrument that you can connect to any other Jack enabled application.
        This can be useful if you want to add effects to a single instrument with
        jack-rack for example.  "Connect to Default Output Pair" connects the output to the
        default ports: uncheck this if you want to connect the JACK output to other
        ports without having to disconnect them first.</para>

        <para>Also keep an eye on the value of "Polyphony": depending on your
        CPU you may want to change the max simultaneous notes in order to
        prevent hydrogen from overrunning the audio driver.</para>
        <para>The "Interpolate resampling" parameter allows you to select your preferred
        interpolation methode.</para>

        <para>The "Midi System" tab (<xref linkend="fig.preferences.midi_tab"/>)
        contains all MIDI settings. Here you can choose the MIDI driver (ALSA, PortMidi, 
        CoreMidi or JackMidi) input, and channel(s) that Hydrogen should respond to.  
        <note><para>If you want to use Jack Session management you should select the 
        JackMidi driver.  Jack Session management can only (re)store Jack midi connections.</para></note>
        You can also define midi bindings: link a midi note/message to an action. 
        To do this simply press the red 'REC' button left of the event-action binding line.  
        A popup will inform you that Hydrogen is waiting for your input.  Press/hit/turn 
        the key/pad/knob on your midi keyboard (or controller) that you want to link to 
        this action.  The popup will close and the Event Param value will now show the 
        midi note value of the key you pressed.  Once this is done you can select an Action 
        from the action drop-down list.  Note that some actions (like SELECT_NEXT_PATTERN) 
        also require an Action Param that references the pattern you want to select with this midi action.</para>

    <!--  TAP TEMPO -->

      <section id="sect.tap_tempo">
        <title>Tap Tempo and BeatCounter</title>

        <para>It is possible to change the tempo at any time using the tap-tempo and
        BeatCounter features of Hydrogen.  You can do this while the song is playing or
        while the song is stopped.  To change the tempo, hit the
        <keycap>,</keycap> (comma) key in the tempo you want.
        After the correct number of keystrokes have been detected (see 
        below for details), the tempo will change to the average tempo 
        you tapped the comma key.  If you continue to tap,
        these new taps will become a part of a rolling average.  If you tap
        accidentally, or if you wait too long between taps, the tap tempo
        counter will start over.</para>

        <para>The Tap Tempo is a part of the BeatCounter, which is essentially a
        Tap Tempo on steroids.  By default the BeatCounter display is not
        visible.  To see the BeatCounter widget click the upright button
        (<guilabel>BC</guilabel>) between Song/Pattern mode selector and the
        BPM-widget, or, simply press the comma key.
        (<keycap>,</keycap>).</para>

        <para>The tempo that you tap will be considered even beats of the song's 
        beat type.  The beat type can be set to 1/8 (for eight-note beats), 1/4 (for
        quarter-note beats), 1/2 (for half-note beats), and 1/1 (for whole-note
        beats).  To change the beat type use the left +/- buttons.  To change
        the Countdown Counter value, use the right +/- buttons.  The Countdown 
        Counter value can be set between 2 and 16 beats.  (I.e. if you set the beat to 6, you will
        have to tap 6 times before the new tempo is computed and set.)  When the
        display shows an <guilabel>R</guilabel>, it means that the BeatCounter
        is ready to start from 0.  When you tap the comma key, the R will change to
        1, and will increment with every keystroke until it reaches the Countdown 
        Counter value (shown just below the 'R').</para>

        <para>The button in the bottom right-hand controls the auto-start
        feature, and it toggles between <guilabel>S</guilabel> and
        <guilabel>P</guilabel>.  When it shows <guilabel>P</guilabel> for
        (<emphasis>Play</emphasis>), the song will set the new tempo and
        automatically start to play after you tap the right number of beats (if
        it's not already playing, of course).  This way, if you have the
        BeatCounter set up for 4/4, you can tap 1-2-3-4, and start playing on
        the next beat.  When it shows <guilabel>S</guilabel> (for <emphasis>Set
        BPM</emphasis>), the auto-start is disabled.</para>

        <para>For example: Suppose you have a live band, Hydrogen, and a
        softsynth that is controlled by Seq24)... and you want them all to start
        at the same time.  Set the beat type to 1/4 and the number of beats to
        4.  Enable auto-start (button shows <guilabel>P</guilabel>).  Count off
        the band 1-2-3-4 (while tapping the comma key) &mdash; and everyone
        starts on 1.</para>

        <para>Another example: Same situation, but the song doesn't require
        Hydrogen or synths until some point later.  During that time, a human
        (e.g. guitar player) will be setting the tempo.  On the measure before
        Hydrogen is supposed to play, tap the comma key 1-2-3-4 with the
        beat... and you're in on the next beat (at the right tempo).</para>

        <para>If you are using the JACK Transport, the BeatCounter continues to
        work.  If another program is the JACK Transport Master, Hydrogen will
        respond to tempo change events from that application.  Note that in this
        situation, Hydrogen is supposed to be a <emphasis>slave</emphasis>, so
        some of the BeatCounter features will be disabled or will not work
        properly.  If Hydrogen is the JACK Transport Master, tempo changes from
        Hydrogen will be reflected in those programs (if they support
        it).</para>

        <para>Some of the settings to adjust the BeatCounter's latency
        compensation, are located on the General tab of the Preferences Dialog 
        (see <xref linkend="sect.preferences.general_tab"/>
        ). Here you will finde two spinboxes:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold"><guilabel>Beat counter drift
          compensation in 1/10ms</guilabel></emphasis> &mdash; adjust to
          compensate for latency between the keyboard and the
          program.</para></listitem>

          <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold"><guilabel>Beat counter start
          offset in ms</guilabel></emphasis> &mdash; adjust the time between the
          BeatCounter's last input stroke and when the song starts playing (if
          auto-start is activated).</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Note that these can be set to positive (+) or negative (-) values.
        In order to find useful values for these, you will need to take some
        time to play with it.  Also, you may want different values depending on
        the speed of your hardware, audio devices, drivers, etc.  Using the
        BeatCounter effectively requires practice.</para>

     <title>Tempo markers and song Tags</title>
       <para>This section describes how you can define tempo changes and 
       how you can add tags to your song.</para>
       <para>The majority of songs consist of several parts (intro, verse, chorus ...) and
       often these parts will have a different tempo.  Hydrogen provides an easy way
       to let you change the tempo of a song at any given moment in the song.  This is 
       done by adding Tempo change Markers to your song.</para>
       <para>To add a Tempo change marker to your song you first need to enable the 'BPM' option
       (the BPM button is located just above the Song editors main controls).  Once this is done
       the horizontal bar next to the BPM button changes to a ruler with marks at every bar.
       Now simply left-click this ruler at the bar you want the tempo to change and a
       window will pop up where you can enter the new tempo.

         </mediaobject>
         </informalfigure>
            
       Once you have entered the new tempo and clicked OK, the tempo change will 
       show up on the tempo ruler.  If you click the Tempo marker again you can edit 
       the tempo, change the bar or delete the tempo marker.

       In addidtion to changing the tempo when the song switches from intro > verse, 
       it is also very handy to have a clear indication of this tempo switch (or any other
       event in the song).  For this purpose you can also ad Tags markers to the song.
       These Tags are short text messages you can add to your song at any given 
       moment that will be displayed whenever the song playhead passes by that Tag.</para>
       
       <para>
       To add a Tag to your song simply middle-click on the song ruler (just below the 
       tempo ruler) and a window will pop up where that allows you to add text for any bar.

           </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
         </informalfigure>

       Once you are done you will see a small blue 'T' in the song ruler for every tag 
       you have entered.  Middle-click anywhere on the song ruler to edit the tags.

       <para>
       Now all we need is a way to see the tags we have entered.  This can be done 
       using the Director window.  Open the Director by pressing Alt-D, or Tools- Director :

            </informalfigure>
       
       The Director is your best friend when you need a quick overview of what Hydrogen
       is currently doing.  This comes in very handy when you are recording a song, or
       if you are using Hydrogen live on stage.</para>
       
       <para>
       The Director shows you the song name, a visual metronome and of course the 
       song Tags.  Just below the metronome you can see the latest tag, and below that 
       the next upcoming tag.  This way you have a nice overview of what is going on, 
       and what is about to happen in the song

          <para>
	        Virtual patterns are a convenient way of grouping patterns together. 
          For example, say you have a song in which three patterns are always 
          played together at the start of each bar. Previously, the way to do this 
          in the pattern matrix was to explicitly enable the three patterns at each bar.
         </para>
         <para>
        	With virtual patterns we can assign a pattern to be a sort of meta-pattern 
	        that implicitly invokes these three patterns together when the new virtual pattern 
	        is enabled in the pattern matrix. This way, we only need to set one pattern every 
	        bar, instead of three.
         </para>
         <para>
        	Virtual patterns provide a function that's similar to the regular pattern editor, and one could argue that 
	        since a virtual pattern is also a regular pattern, we could have just merged the three 
	        patterns into this new one. However, the advantage that virtual patterns provide is that 
	        if one of the original three patterns changes, the virtual pattern automatically inherits 
        	the change. A virtual pattern can also invoke other virtual patterns.

        The simplest way to create a pattern is by adding notes using your mouse

        depends on the used pattern size and resolution.</para>
        <para>If you are using Hydrogen as a pure 'drum' you just want Hydrogen to 'hit' 
        the instrument wherever there's a 'dot' in the pattern. If you are using Hydrogen as an 'instrument', the 
        length of the note becomes very important. There are 2 ways to define the length of
        a note : in 'Note Length' mode you can add a note by left-cliking, and you can 'stretch' that note by right-click-dragging it.
        This will change the dot into a rectangle that represents the duration of that note.  In 'Note Off' mode you can also add a
        note by left-clicking, but a right-click will now add a blue dot that represents the end of that note.

      <para>Clicking on an instrument or adding/removing a note next to it 
      will select this instrument.  Once an instrument is selected the note properties 
      for this instrument will be shown in the form of vertical lines in the bottom window.  
      The lines represent the value for the selected property of each note of the selected instrument.  
      You can select another note-property from the note property drop-down list (located bottom-left).  
      There are 4 note properties available :

          Note that the color of the note-dot and the vertical bar will change according to the velocity value you have defined. 
          A light shade of gray means a low velocity (low volume) and the higher you set the velocity the darker the color will be,

      <para>The Mixer window can be opened by pressing Alt+M, by clicking 
      Mixer in the Tools menu, or by clicking the Mixer button on the main toolbar.
      </para>
      <para>The Mixer consists of 3 sections (left>right) : the instrument channel strips, 
      the FX plugin rack and the master fader section.  The Hydrogen Mixer works very
       much like a hardware mixer does : it lets you set the volume, pan, FX and several 
       other things for every instrument.

         The play button lets you trigger the instrument at maximum velocity (handy for checking clipping), 
       and the trig led lights up whenever this instrument is triggered (from the song sequence, 
       or by an external midi controller).  Right of this button/led you will find another led that shows
       you what instrument is currently selected.  This is also the instrument that is selected in the pattern editor.
       As soon as you change one of the settings of a channel strip the instrument will be selected.</para>

      Next are 4 pre-fader FX send knobs that determine how much of this instrument will be sent to
      the effect plugins in the FX rack.

        <para>A badly designed LADSPA plugin is capable of
        hanging, crashing, freezing, screeching, overflowing buffers, and even
        phoning home.  If you start having issues with Hydrogen, disable your
        plugins and see if things improve.  Some plugins are not designed for

      <title>Sound Library (Drumkit/Pattern/Song Manager)</title>

      <para>First of all a little history on the Sound library and Drumkits. Hydrogen began as a 
      dedicated drum machine but has evolved into a versatile sound synthesizer/sequencer 
      that is capable of generating and manipulating all sorts of sounds. Hence the original 
      "Drumkit" terminology is slightly misleading. You can load any kind of sound into a
      "Drumkit" and manipulate that sound just like playing a regular synthesizer. This is 
      also the main reason why the Piano mode was added to the pattern editor 
      (see <xref linkend="sect.pattern_editor.piano_mode"/>).</para>
      <para>In this manual (and in other documentation) "Drumkit" and "Soundlibrary" 
      frequently mean the same thing, but not always. The diagram below shows the actual 
      relation between the Soundlibrary and Drumkits:

        </figure>
      
      As you can see the Soundlibrary contains all Drumkits (System and User drumkits), 
      your saved Patterns and your saved Songs.  Each Drumkit is a collection of a number
      of instruments (snare, kick, sampled voice, bass sound ...) and in its turn an instrument can consist of multiple
      layered samples.  Note that every block has a number of parameters (continue reading for more details).</para>
      <para>This said. let's take a look at the Soundlibrary interface and see what it can do for you:</para>
      <para>The Sound Library saves you time in managing your drum kits,
      favourite patterns, and favourite songs.  When making new songs and new drum
      kits, it allows you to reuse and mix the instruments and patterns from other kits and songs.

        <title>Concepts</title>

        <para>
          The synthesizer in Hydrogen is a sample-based synthesizer.  A sample
          is a piece of pre-recorded audio (usually between 0.1 sec and 3 sec).
          To play a note, the sample is simply played back at the right time.
          There are a few concepts and terms that you should understand when you
          are putting together a drumkit.  (See <xref linkend="glossary"/> for
          more detailed explanations.)

        <para>
          Typical samples that are used in Hydrogen are: the sound of a single
          drum hit, the sound of a single cymbal hit, the sound of a single
          cowbell hit.  Whenever you put a note in the pattern (or play a note
          using MIDI), Hydrogen will play whatever sound you have loaded.  So,
          to put together a drum kit you need to gather short recordings of the
          bass drum, each tom, each cymbal, the high hat open, the high hat
          closed, the snare drum (snare on), the snare drum (snare off), rim
          shots, etc.
        </para>

        <para>
          However, there are no rules about what a sample can be.  It's not
          uncommon to use Hydrogen to trigger non-drum sounds like: audio clips
          of people talking, a clip from a song, sound effects, audio clips from
          movies, and famous people speaking.  Be creative!

            worse as Hydrogen processes it.</para>
          </warning>

          <para>Hydrogen provides more mute groups than you know what to do with
          (over 256).  A mute group is a grouping of instruments that are
          mutually exclusive &mdash; only one instrument may be playing at any
          time.  If one is playing and another instrument in the group is
          triggered, it will immediately silence (mute) and start playing the
          other instrument.  This is useful, especially, for instruments like
          hi-hats where the open sound and the closed sound are different
          instruments.</para>

          <para>If the mute group is set to "<guilabel>Off</guilabel>", then the
          instrument is not part of any mute grouping.  If the mute group is set
          to any number, then that is the group that the instrument is a part
          of.  To set other instruments into the same grouping, set their mute
          group parameter to the same number.  (For example, to group all the
          high-hat instruments, you can set all their mute group parameters to
          1.  To have a snare drum mute group, set their mute group parameters
          to 2.)</para>

          <para>Hydrogen is capable of generating midi messages that you can use

          configure the Midi out channel and Note for every instrument.  As you can see
          this is a very flexible approach that enables you to trigger samples or sounds
          from multiple devices and/or apps.  Finally you need to make sure the proper 
          Midi routing/wiring is in place and you're set.
          </para>

          <para>From now on every time a note is played for that instrument (in the Hydrogen sequencer) 
          a midi message will be sent to your external app/device and trigger a sound.  
          This way you can use Hydrogen as a pure sequencer for other apps, or combine the 
          internal Hydrogen sampler with multiple external apps/devices.</para>

          <para>This option is particularly useful when you are using long samples like a 
          crash or some existing audio that you have sampled (like a looped voice in a 
          dance/electro song)  For the crash you will need to use the Auto Stop-Note when 
          you are sequencing multiple notes in fast succession and want to make it sound realistic.  If you do 
          not check this option the cymbal will start to sound like multiple cymbals 
          instead of only one (since the sample of each individual hit will be played completely).
          For the voice sample this option is useful if you are trying to get that 'stuttering' effect.

        then click <guibutton>Load Layer</guibutton> to bring in another
        sample.</para>

        <para>After bringing in both samples, you'll probably notice that only
        the <emphasis>first</emphasis> sample is being played whenever you
        trigger the instrument.  This is because you need to set the
        <emphasis>velocity</emphasis> ranges for the layers.  Move your mouse to
        the sides of the light blue rectangles and you see that you get a
        left-right drag cursor.  Now drag the sample to the left or right (like
        a curtain).  You will now see Layer 2 appear.</para>

        <para>The velocity setting for the layer is 0-velocity on the left, and
        full velocity on the right.  Set up Layer 1 to sound for soft notes, and
        Layer 2 to sound for hard notes (i.e. Layer 1 on the left and Layer 2
        on the right).</para>

        <para>Now, in the pattern area, set up a simple pattern that plays this
        instrument.  Adjust the velocity settings on each note so that you can
        get the different samples to sound.  Now set the pattern to loop and
        notice how your different samples are getting triggered.  (To learn
        about editing a pattern, see <xref
        linkend="sect.pattern_editor"/>)</para>

        <para>For each layer, you can set the <guibutton>Gain</guibutton> and
        the <guibutton>Pitch</guibutton>.  The pitch also has a
        <guibutton>Fine</guibutton> adjustment.</para>

        <para>Use the <guibutton>Gain</guibutton> adjustment to control how loud
        the sample will play.  This is necessary because it's extremely
        difficult to get a set of samples that all sound at about the same
        volume.  By adjusting here, the samples that were recorded too quietly
        can be turned up to match your loud samples (that had to be turned
        down).</para>

        <warning>
          <para>It is very easy to set the <guibutton>Gain</guibutton> too high,
          causing your sample to clip.  Remember to test the gain with
          full-velocity notes.  If you clip your signal here, it will only get
          worse as Hydrogen processes it.</para>
        </warning>

        <para>The pitch of the sample can be modified with the pitch controls.
        The <guibutton>Pitch</guibutton> knob adjust the pitch in musical
        half-steps.  (So, -12 is down 1 octave).  The pitch on the right adjusts
        the pitch &plusmn;50 cents.  (One half-step is 100 cents.)</para>

        <note>
          <para>The pitch is adjusted by playing the sample back faster or
          slower.  This is called the Doppler Effect.  So, if you have a
          1-second sample that you turn down -12 (1 octave), your sample will
          only last for .5-seconds.  If you do not want this to happen you should
          use rubberband instead (see <xref linkend="sect.layer_editing.section2"/>)</para>
        </note>

        <para>You can hear the sample in a layer by clicking the layer id (just 
        below the 'General' and 'Layers' buttons) and the 'Delete Layer' button 
        will delete the currently selected layer.</para>

        <title>Sample Editor</title>
        <para>So far we have created a multilayered Drumkit, set a number of 
        instrument parameters, played with velocity settings and so on.  Now it's 
        time to go one step deeper and edit the samples using one of the newest
        Hydrogen features: the Sample Editor.</para>
        <para>The Sample Editor allows you to tweak and manipulate your samples.
        This is a function that will really speed up the creation of a drumkit since
        you can do the fine-tunning of the sample within Hydrogen. In pre-0.9.5 builds
        the typical workflow would be to prepare your sample in an external sound editor,
        import the sample in Hydrogen, test it, go back to the audio editor, import again, 
        test ...  The sample editor allows you to do most of the sample manipulation 
        within Hydrogen.  This mean less switching between Hydrogen and your audio editor
        and more time to make music !</para>
        
        <note>
        <para>The changes you make to
        your samples in the Sample Editor are <emphasis role="bold">non-destructive
        </emphasis> and are saved <emphasis role="bold">per song</emphasis>.  
        So the original sample will not be changed,
        and you can reuse the same sample in multiple songs with different Sample Editor
        settings.</para>

        <para>The Sample Editor consists of 3 sections (as indicated in the figure above):</para>
       
        <section id="sect.layer_editing.section1">
        <title>Sample Editor in/out points</title>
        <para>
        In this section you can set the start, stop and loop points for the sample by dragging the 
        the 3 markers:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>S-marker (green) : indicates the Start-point (in-point) of the sample.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>E-marker (red) : indicates the End-point (out-point) of the sample.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>L-marker (blue) : determines the loop-in point of your sample</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        You can easily move one of the markers by grabbing them close to the
        letter that marks them.  Whenever you grab one of the markers you will see a detail
        view of the position of that marker on the second (smaller) window on the right, making it easy to 
        find the zero-crossings in the sample.  This detail window also has a slider next to
        it that allows you to zoom in and out on the vertical axis. Think of it as a sort of 
        volume 'zoom'.
        </para>
        <para>Underneath these 2 windows you can find (from left>right) : the position of the Start
        marker, the position of the Loop marker, the Loop mode, the number of loops and the
        position of the End marker.  The position of the markers is expressed in number of
        samples from the very beginning of the sample.  These values will change if you drag the markers,
        but you can also fine-tune the marker position by using the up/down arrows of the spinboxes, 
        the up/down keys on your keyboard, or by using your mouse scroll wheel while hovering
        above the spinboxes.</para>
        <para>Apart from the marker positions there are 2 settings that apply to the Sample
        Editor's loop function: loop mode and loop number.  With the loop function you can
        repeat the part of your sample <emphasis>that is in between the Loop- and the 
        End-marker</emphasis>. The way it is looped is determined by the Loop mode 
        (forward, revers or ping-pong) and the number of times it is looped is determined
        by the Loop number.</para>
        <para>If you want to hear a preview of the tweaking you have done so far, you first need to
        press the 'Apply Changes' button (@ the bottom of section 3) and then the Play button to
        hear the result.</para>

        <title>Sample Editor rubberband</title>
        <para>This section of the Sample Editor allows you to control the Rubberband settings.
        Rubberband is a tool that can change the tempo of a sample without changing 
        the sample's pitch (and vice versa).</para>
        <para>If you are using Ubuntu you can install rubberband from the Software Center

        <title>Tips on Editing Instruments</title>

        <para>With all of the different parameters available to tweak, it can be
        difficult to set up something that sounds nice when you're done.  Here are 
        a few tips on setting up an instrument:</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Turn down the gain.</emphasis> Every gain
        knob (i.e. an amplifier), this is a <emphasis>gain stage</emphasis>.  
        With every gain stage you have, it's
        easy to overdrive your signal &mdash; which means the signal gets
        distorted by clipping.  In addition, if you have two samples that, by
        themselves, peg your meters &mdash; what do you think happens when you
        combine them?  That's right, you overdrive the signal again.</para>

        <para>If things sound bad and distorted, start by turning down the gain
        setting on the layer... especially if it's larger than 1.0.  Then turn
        down the instrument gain.  Then any gain on a LADSPA effect.  Then the
        fader on the mixer.  Then the master output fader.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Test samples at full velocity.</emphasis>
        Your sample will be played louder if the velocity is higher.  So, if you
        set everything to sound nice and full with velocity at 0.7, what will
        happen when you get a full velocity of 1.0?  (<emphasis>Hint:
        clipping.</emphasis>)</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Try to use samples that are -6 dB
        max.</emphasis> Visually, this means samples that peak at only
        1/2 of full scale.  Otherwise, turn your layer gain to about
        .5.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Remove all DC offsets from the
        sample.</emphasis> In a sample editor, there is usually a line down the
        center of your sample's waveform.  This is the zero-line.  The beginning
        of your sample should be on this line.  The end of your sample should
        also be on this line.  However, if your signal is a little above or a
        little below this line, you will hear a click at the beginning and the
        end of your sample whenever it is played.  If your sample editor doesn't
        provide any tools to fix a DC offset problem, you can eliminate the
        noise by putting a slight fade-in/out at the ends of your sample.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">The ADSR will not be longer than your
        sample.</emphasis> If you have a short sample, it doesn't matter how
        long you set the attack and delay &mdash; the sample will stop playing
        at the end.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Things change with the sample
        rate.</emphasis> If you have a really nice setup with all your
        parameters painstakenly tweaked... things <emphasis>will</emphasis>
        change if you change the sample rate of your audio card.  Many of
        Hydrogen's internal settings and parameters are based on how many
        samples go by, not on how many seconds go by.  The sorts of things
        that change are: anything time-base (like attack and release) and
        anything frequency based (like the cutoff frequency).</para>

      <title>"Song" mode and "Pattern" mode</title>

      <para>This section is a quick-and-dirty walkthrough to Hydrogen. Refer to the
      tutorial for a more detailed overview.</para>

      <para>Hydrogen has 2 main modes: "Pattern" mode and "Song" mode (refer to
      <xref linkend="sect.main_toolbar"/> for the buttons that activate each mode). When
      "Pattern" mode is activated the current pattern is continuously repeated.
      This mode is very well suited to tweak your pattern until it's just right, since the 
      pattern you are working on is constantly repeated. This way you can immediately 
      hear the changes you have made. In "Song" mode the whole song is played.  
      This is useful when putting together the patterns to create the structure of the song.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="sect.create_pattern">
      <title>A new pattern</title>




      <para>We'll start from the empty song with an empty pattern created when
      Hydrogen starts up: "pattern" mode should be selected by default. Now
      let's click on the <quote>Play</quote>button, and while the pattern is playing
      let's add notes by left_mouse_clicking in the grid of the Song Editor 
      (<xref linkend="fig.pattern_editor.2"/>). Adjust the grid resolution and BPM
      speed if needed. Remember some constraints of the grid: if you are
      working with a resolution of 16 you can't go back to 8 and remove a
      16th note; same thing happens if you are working with a resolution of
      8 and you try to insert a note in the middle of two bars (looking for
      a 16 bars precision): they will be placed on the previous or on the
      following 8th bar (unless you choose <quote>off</quote> from the Grid Resolution LCD in which case
      you're free to place notes wherever you prefer). <emphasis role="bold">Be
      sure to select the correct pattern in the Song Editor before adding notes
      in the Pattern Editor!</emphasis></para>

        indicates the maximum volume reached from the instrument.   The peak must
        be in a range of 0.0 and 1.0 (in <xref linkend="fig.mixer.2"/> you can
        see a few volumes too loud).  Peaks outside that range will get distorted 
        (especially with OSS audio driver). Keep an eye on each vu-meter and
        if distortion appears, turn the volume down for that instrument.

    <title>Glossary</title>

    <para>This is a glossary of general terms encountered when using Hydrogen,
     synthesizers, drums, or samplers. The definitions here provide more
     detail and explanation than the simplified ones in the text. For
     example, the text of the manual would have you believe that an ADSR is
     the only kind of envelope generator and could only ever control the
     volume. While the simplified definitions help new users start using
     Hydrogen quickly, they can lack the nuances presented here.</para>

    <glossentry id="def.clipping">
      <glossterm>Clipping</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>A phenomenon that happens to a signal when the signal is too large
        for whatever is receiving it.  The peaks of the signal (which are
        normally smooth curves) get cut off straight at the max volume
        (clipped).  This distorts the sound and is usually undesirable.</para>

        <para>An example of clipping is when you play music louder than your
        speaker can handle.  Parts of the music sound harsh and fuzzy.</para>

    <glossentry id="def.cutoff">
      <glossterm>Cutoff Frequency</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>On high-pass and low-pass filters, this is the frequency that
        divides between those that pass, and those that are attenuated
        (silenced).  In a high-pass resonance filter, or a low-pass resonance
        filter, the cutoff is also the frequency zone that gets boosted.</para>

        <para>For example, if you have a low-pass filter and you set the cutoff
        frequency high (i.e. 20kHz)... the filter will not affect the sound.
        All the audible frequencies will pass through undisturbed.  As you lower
        the cutoff frequency to something like 40 Hz (the low string on a bass
        guitar), it sounds like someone is putting a blanket over the speaker.
        The higher frequencies are being attenuated above 30 Hz.</para>

      <glossdef>
        <para>DC offset, or DC coefficient is the mean value of the wavefor.m</para>
        <para>DC offset is usually undesirable. For example, in audio processing, a 
        sound that has DC offset will not be at its loudest possible volume when
        normalized (because the offset consumes headroom), and this problem can 
        possibly extend to the mix as a whole, since a sound with DC offset and a sound
        without DC offset will have DC offset when mixed. It may also cause other artifacts
        depending on what is being done with the signal.</para>

    <glossentry id="def.mutegroup">
      <glossterm>Mute Group</glossterm>
      <glossdef>
        <para>A group of instruments (samples) that should mute (stop playing)
        immediately after another instrument in the group is triggered.</para>

        <para>This is typically used in hi-hats, where there's a different
        instrument (sample) for when the hi-hat is open or closed.  With a real
        hi-hat, the sound of the open hi-hat will stop as soon as you close it.
        However, if you use two samples &mdash; the open sound will continue
        even after you have triggered the closed sound.  By placing both
        instruments in the same mute group (group #1, for example)... triggering
        closed sound will immediately stop the open sound (and vice
        versa).</para>

        filter, where the boosted frequencies are centered on the cut-off
        frequency.</para>

      <glossdef>
        <para>This is the amount that frequencies are attenuated (suppressed) as
        the frequency changes (typically measured in dB/octave).</para>

        <para>For example, in a low-pass filter the frequencies below the cutoff
        frequency are not attenuated (they pass-through with the same volume).
        Same with the cutoff frequency.  As you go above the cutoff frequency,
        the frequencies that are near the cutoff frequency are not attenuated
        very much at all.  However, the frequencies that are much higher than
        the cutoff are attenuated (suppressed) a lot.  This is usually
        approximated by a straight line (on a log scale) and measured in in dB
        of attenuation per octave of frequency.</para>

msgid "Ok, you've just downloaded the latest version of Hydrogen and have it installed successfully. Now you want to test it while creating your favourite song, this might help you to learn it, writing down a few difficult parts in order to play them over and over again or to be sure that in future a quick glance at the songfile will bring up immediately to mind the song. Hydrogen can be used also as an advanced <quote>click</quote> machine that can help you practicing (in speed, precision and rudiments), maybe with a custom pattern designed by yourself. This short introduction will guide you creating a a complete song, we will work on \"Georgy Porgy\" of Toto which has a quite straight structure therefore is appropriate for a guide but this doenst mean the song is _actually_ easy to write down since the drummer (Jeff Porcaro) enriches the groove with his personal touch and fantasy; Hydrogen will not play better than the drummer who is working on the song, most of the task must be accomplished by the programmer's sensibility and experience."

msgid "The base pattern (Fig. 1 and 2) is 4 bars long (divided in 2 different bars, each repeated 2 times, so it's [2a*2]+[2b*2]) and lasts for the whole song, from the beginning to the end, riff included; most of the time (intro and riff excluded) this base pattern is repeated 2 times to reach the commonly used 8 bars for each part of the song (A,B,C). Before starting let's set the speed to 98bpm (HINT HINT you can find out by yourself the speed of the song while playing it with your favourite media player and following the rhythm by clicking repeatedly the backslash key in Hydrogen) and from the menu <quote>Grid Resolution</quote> let's set '16'. To create a new pattern select the instrument <quote>Closed HH</quote>, click on RMB and choose <quote>Fill Notes</quote>: the first two bars will be filled up. Then insert manually the beats on Snare Jazz and Kick as indicated in the 2 pictures below and there we have the base pattern for our song. Note how the beats on the hi-hat have different 'hardness': beats falling on the beginning of the bar are set at [0.78], the others at [0.50] (you can check that on the lower stat bar of Hydrogen), in order to give groove the song."

We have to copy+paste in a new line a pattern already written (ex. <quote>A-B-C_3+4</quote>), rename it to <quote>A-B-C_8</quote> and modify it as in Fig. 4.

As noted in the introduction of this guide, Jeff Porcaro puts much of his skills playing the song and this makes the difference between a song played from a raw and \"cold\" transcription on paper (or on Hydrogen): therefore the following parts of the song will try to be faithful to the original piece, but another 'ear' could give another written layout of the same part: after all this doesnt matter so much since we are showing how a program works, not to play like Porcaro :)"

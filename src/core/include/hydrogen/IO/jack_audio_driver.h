/**
 * JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) server driver. 
 *
 * __Timebase Master__:
 *
 * The timebase master is responsible to update additional information
 * in the transport information of the JACK server apart from the
 * transport position in frames (see TransportInfo::m_nFrames if you
 * aren't familiar with frames), like the current beat, bar, tick,
 * tick size, speed etc. Every client can be registered as timebase
 * master by supplying a callback (for Hydrogen this would be
 * jack_timebase_callback()) but there can be at most one timebase
 * master at a time. Having none at all is perfectly fine too. Apart
 * from this additional responsibility, the registered client has no
 * other rights compared to others.
 *
 * After the status of the JACK transport has changed from
 * _JackTransportStarting_ to _JackTransportRolling_, the timebase
 * master needs an additional cycle to update its information.
 *
 * __Transport Control__:
 *
 * Each JACK client can start and stop the transport or relocate its
 * current position. The request will take place in cycles. During the
 * first the status of the transport changes to
 * _JackTransportStarting_ to inform all clients a change is about to
 * happen. During the second the status is again
 * _JackTransportRolling_ and the transport position is updated
 * according to the request. But only its raw representation in frames
 * in the _frame_ member. The current timebase master, if present,
 * needs another cycle to update the additional transport
 * information. 
 *
 * Such a relocation request is also triggered when clicking on the
 * timeline or the player control buttons of Hydrogen. Internally,
 * audioEngine_stop() is called during the cycle in which the JACK
 * transport status is _JackTransportStarting_ and started again by
 * audioEngine_start() when in _JackTransportRolling_ in the next
 * cycle. Note that if there are slow synchronizing client in JACK's
 * connection graph, it can take multiple cycles until the JACK
 * transport is rolling again.
 *
 * Also note that Hydrogen overwrites its local TransportInfo stored
 * in AudioOutput::m_transport only with the transport position of the
 * JACK server if a relocation did happened or another timebase master
 * did change the speed. During normal transport the current position
 * TransportInfo::m_nFrames will be always the same as the one of JACK
 * during a cycle and incremented by the buffer size in
 * audioEngine_process() at the very end of the cycle. The same
 * happens for the transport information of the JACK server but in
 * parallel. 
 *
 * This object will only be accessible if #H2CORE_HAVE_JACK was defined
 * during the configuration and the user enables the support of the
 * JACK server.

/**
* @class NsmClient
*
* @brief Non session manager client implementation
*
* Non session management (NSM) is the name for both a standard/API
* allowing for a reproducible, multi-application session handling in
* Linux systems as well as for the actual application - the
* non-session-manager - implementing it.
*
* Hydrogen is compliant with the standard, send dirty flag to the NSM
* server to indicate unsaved changes, and is able to switch between
* different sessions without restarting the entire
* application. However, Hydrogen does use several files to store all
* options the user is able to customize and not all of them are stored
* inside the folder provided by the NSM server. While the song file
* will be kept there, both the drumkit and preferences are stored
* elsewhere. Altering either of them can very well affect the state of
* the individual session, e.g. by disabling a prior set the per track
* output option of the JACK driver outside of the session and
* restarting it. So, be very careful.

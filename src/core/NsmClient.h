/**
* @class NsmClient
*
* @brief Non session manager client implementation
*
* Non session management (NSM) is the name for both a standard/API
* allowing for a reproducible, multi-application session handling in
* Linux systems as well as for the actual application - the
* non-session-manager - implementing it.
*
* Hydrogen tries to be compliant with the standard, sends dirty flag to the NSM
* server to indicate unsaved changes, and is able to switch between different
* sessions without restarting the entire application. However, Hydrogen does use
* several files to store all options the user is able to customize and not all
* of them are stored inside the folder provided by the NSM server. Both the song
* and a custom copy of the preferences will be stored in the session folder.
*
* But the all samples of the sessions song's drumkit are not part of the session
* folder per default. However, the user is present an option in the main menu to
* store the current kit in the session folder. If one is encountered there, it
* will be loaded as a session kit.

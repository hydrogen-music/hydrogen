/**
* @class NsmClient
*
* @brief Non session manager client implementation
*
* Non session management (NSM) is the name for both a standard/API
* allowing for a reproducible, multi-application session handling in
* Linux systems as well as for the actual application - the
* non-session-manager - implementing it.
*
* Hydrogen is compliant with the standard, sends dirty flag to the NSM
* server to indicate unsaved changes, and is able to switch between
* different sessions without restarting the entire
* application. However, Hydrogen does use several files to store all
* options the user is able to customize and not all of them are stored
* inside the folder provided by the NSM server. Both the song and a
* custom copy of the preferences will be stored in the session
* folder. But the drumkit used in the song will only be linked into it.

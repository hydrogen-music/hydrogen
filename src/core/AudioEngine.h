	 * speed of the transport (as JACK timebase master) or the transport
	 * position. In such cases, Hydrogen has to sync its internal transport
	 * state AudioOutput::m_transport to reflect these changes. Else our
	 * playback would be off.
	 * - calls audioEngine_process_checkBPMChanged() to check whether the
	 * tick size, the number of frames per bar (size of a pattern), has
	 * changed (see TransportInfo::m_nFrames in case you are unfamiliar
	 * with the term _frames_). This is necessary because the transport
	 * position is often given in ticks within Hydrogen and changing the
	 * speed of the Song, e.g. via Hydrogen::setBPM(), would thus result
	 * in a(n unintended) relocation of the transport location.
	 * - calls audioEngine_updateNoteQueue() and
	 * audioEngine_process_playNotes(), two functions which handle the
	 * selection and playback of notes and will documented at a later
	 * point in time
	 * - If audioEngine_updateNoteQueue() returns with 2, the
	 * EVENT_PATTERN_CHANGED event will be pushed to the EventQueue.
	 * - writes the audio output of the Sampler, Synth, and the LadspaFX
	 * (if #H2CORE_HAVE_LADSPA is defined) to audio output buffers, and
     * sets we peak values for #m_fFXPeak_L,
	 * #m_fFXPeak_R, #m_fMasterPeak_L, and #m_fMasterPeak_R.
	 * - finally increments the transport position
	 * TransportInfo::m_nFrames with the buffersize @a nframes. So, if
	 * this function is called during the next cycle, the transport is

	 * - @b Lead/Lag - A deterministic offset determined by

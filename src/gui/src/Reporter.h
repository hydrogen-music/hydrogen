/** Crash reporter class
 *
 * The crash reporter provides a split-process model for reporting crashes from Hydrogen, with a simple GUI
 * giving options to view the log file, other details or open a browser to the issue tracker.
 *
 * Early on, the calling process should call #Reporter::spawn(). For the parent process, this causes the child
 * to be spawned (adding "--child" to command line arguments), and the parent process will wait for the
 * termination of the child, and report a crash if an abnormal exit occurs, or just exit silently
 * otherwise. The parent never returns from #Reporter::spawn().
 *
 * The child process will identify itself through having "--child" in the command line arguments, and continue
 * as normal.
 *
 * The Logger 'crash context' can be reported by the child process during a crash by using #Reporter::report().
 *
 * The parent process passes through stdout and sterr from the child process, but also notes any reported
 * crash context, which is communicated by stderr with a specific prefix. Recent lines from stderr / stdout
 * are recorded in the parent (reporter) process to be displayed as crash details if needed.

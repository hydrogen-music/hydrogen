	 * To allow buttons to be listed in a grid within a grid inside
	 * the PreferencesDialog > Appearance > Interface tab, a small
	 * hack is required.
	 *
	 * Using the regular show() and hide() methods when increasing the
	 * number of colors in the Song Editor, both spacing and placement
	 * of the buttons will be really awkward. I would like to put them
	 * in a right-aligned horizontal list spanning multiple rows with
	 * buttons having a constant spacing between them. However, when
	 * when using a regular QGridLayout and having, say, 2 buttons - 2
	 * colors in the song editor - and all the others are hidden, Qt
	 * will create two columns of same size taking all the space and
	 * put the buttons into them. The result looks like one button is
	 * placed on the right border (what we expect) and the other one
	 * right into the middle of the field of the outer grid (what we
	 * do not expect). This looks awkward until enough buttons are
	 * shown to fill one entire line.
	 *
	 * Introducing spacers, column stretching, or similar things lead
	 * to the buttons being pushed slightly outside the outer grid
	 * layout. When resizing the preferences dialog only the button
	 * list was changing position which was really ugly.
	 *
	 * As a work around, we do not hide any of the buttons but just
	 * paint them transparently as if they are not there. This we call
	 * #m_bHiding and trigger it with #pretendToHide() and
	 * #pretendToShow(). We always have a sufficient amount of colors
	 * to fill a row and expanding of the dialog works like a charm
	 * again.

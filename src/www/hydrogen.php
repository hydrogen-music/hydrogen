		Use this script if you want to share your hydrogen songs,patterns and
		drumkits with other people. It generates a xml-file which can be used
		with the hydrogen soundlibrary.

		Just place this script in one directory with all your drumkits, songs
		and patterns and make it available via a webserver.

		Songs and patterns could be parsed in place. Since drumkits are archives,
		we cannot parse the files at runtime. Therefore, just the name and the url of the drumkit will be used.
		If you want additional informations ( such as author / info ) take a look
		at the metaInfo.inc file (the file has to be in the same directory as this script).
